new discipline for developing and optimizing prompts to efficiently use language models (LMs) for a wide variety of applications and research topics. Â use prompt engineering to improve the capacity of LLMs on a wide range of common and complex tasks such as question answering and arithmetic reasoning. Developers use prompt engineering to design robust and effective prompting techniques that interface with LLMs and other tools.
